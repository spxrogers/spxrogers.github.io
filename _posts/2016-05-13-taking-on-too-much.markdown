my partner always tells me that my fatal flaw is ambition (with a special regard to my professional career). I never believed her when she told me I'm working too much, until very recently. 

so here I am, currently at ~30,000 feet or so drinking stale airplane coffee and taking a break from sketching out a new startup's first product line iteration to write this post. feeling exhausted. 

a quick overview of my recent 18 months:

- i worked on completing my CS degree at UT Austin as a full time student
- interned at Amazon over summer (returning full time after graduation)
- launched 1.0 of my first startup [(ReKall)][rk]
- began the development & release of ReKall's 2.0 launch
- consulted two groups in their idea & prototype phases
- began a new side project with the ReKall team
- joined another startup as a tech-adviser and coordinated hiring three engineers for the project
- officially joined the founding team of a another group as their head of product
- various smaller projects
- and tried to manage a long distance relationship (thank you darling, you were my rock). 

### but why?

I didn't know how to say "no." I wanted to do things. to build up cool shit and grow as an engineer and entrepreneur. 

### why learning to say "no" is important. 

the quality of work and time commitment to each of your current obligations diminishes. that's a simple product of over-extending yourself and over-allocating your time. I started drinking a lot more coffee (side note: a quad shot of espresso over ice in the morning is refreshing and delicious) and sleeping a lot less. 

I'm not saying that I'm at a point where I regret taking on the projects and things I have, because I'd 104% choose the same if I could turn back time. but it has **not** been an entirely healthy process emotionally and I did learn that:

- personal health is vital. 
- managing your time is a learned skill. 
- giving time to and being present in your relationships is important. 
- saying "no" won't burn a bridge if you're transparent, respectful, and foster it for future opportunities. 

while finishing this draft, I came across a blog post by Ash Furrow, an iOS Engineer that's been really helpful in both the iOS community and in my personal mobile-dev growth, [(here)][ashblag] and if this wasn't awful in your eyes, i recommend you check his perspective out. but i really like the way Ash came to say "no":

> I'd love to, but I can't.

"That's it."
