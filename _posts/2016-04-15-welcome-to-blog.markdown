Just over a year ago, I setup this domain to be a single-paged personal site for
UT Austin's upcoming career fair to have "something" up to point recruiters
that I spoke with to.

And it worked. It was simple, not-over-the-top, and it did the job.

However, over the last three to five weeks or so, I've been having moments in
my life where either I do something or something happens and I'm in the moment
thinking:

> I could do a blog post about that, or something . . .
> - me

So we're here now. If only I kept a drafts backlog of those above-mentioned
potential posts.
