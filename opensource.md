## Open Source Software

I believe having open-source software is awesome.

**I believe _supporting_ open-source software is vital.**

The open source community has helped me grow a lot as an engineer and pick up new skills, learn design patterns, and so much more. I think it's valuable to engineering and tech at every level –– if you have the chance to get involved/support I really encourage you to! I'm hoping to write a bit more at length on OSS soon :)
