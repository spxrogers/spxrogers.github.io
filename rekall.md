A mobile and web platform designed to provide everyone with comprehensive day-to-day Life
Security that matters.

ReKall is the safe place to store your lifeâ€™s puzzle pieces and give access to
the people that you trust the most when you need them the most.

ReKall provides a secure, digital vault to store any and all critical care
information as well as day to day life information that each individual user deems necessary to
their own life. That information is then made available to the users' loved ones that
they assign each information item to in a way that is safe, secure, and
efficient.

ReKall was inspired when Kevin, a dear friend of our team was in a tragic snow-sports
accident and suffered a TBI. We wanted to help keep his life in order, but
didn't know where to start. ReKall is now here to help.

No more are the days where life happens unexpectedly and our loved ones are
left scrambling to assist us in our time of need. Let us help you.

ReKall your Life.
